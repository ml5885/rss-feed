## RSS Feed

This is a simple RSS feed reader that lets you subscribe to and read RSS feeds in a clean, minimalistic interface. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To run the project, first start the proxy server:

```bash
node proxy-server.js
```

We need the proxy server to avoid CORS issues when fetching RSS feeds.

Finally, open `index.html` in your web browser (or http://localhost:xxxx if you started a local server). Enjoy!
